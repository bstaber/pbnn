## Getting started

### Install guide

You can install this package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pbnn
```

Note that `pbnn` relies on JAX which will be installed through BlackJAX, the main dependance of this package. 
The code will run on CPU only unless you install JAX with GPU support (see [officiel instructions](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)).

### Documentation

API documentation and several examples of usage can be found in the [online documentation](https://pbnn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?pbnn=latest).
